Lab Activity 1: Overview of Machine Learning Applications

<h2>MACHINE LEARNING FOR AGRICULTURE</h2>
<p>Machine learning in agriculture allows farmers to use lavish amounts of data about climate change, crop and soil conditions, and other environmental variables to make informed decisions about plant and animal treatment.</p>

<h2>MACHINE LEARNING FOR HEALTHCARE</h2>
<p>Machine learning in healthcare is used to draw insights from large medical data sets to facilitate clinicians' decision-making, improve patient outcomes, automate healthcare professionalsâ€™ daily workflows, accelerate medical research, and increase operational efficiency.</p>

<h2>MACHINE LEARNING FOR FRAUD-DETECTION</h2>
<p>Machine learning-based fraud detection systems rely on ML algorithms that can be trained with historical data on past fraudulent or legitimate activities to autonomously identify the characteristic patterns of these events and recognize them once they recur.</p>
